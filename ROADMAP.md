# GitHub Actions for Emacs - Development Plan

Building a Magit-style interface for GitHub Actions workflows in Emacs, step by step from MVP to full-featured tool.

## Phase 1: MVP - Core Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED

1. **Rename and restructure package** âœ…

   - Rename `hello-world.el` to `gh-actions.el`
   - Update package metadata and dependencies
   - Add required dependencies: `transient`, `request`, `json`

2. **Basic GitHub API integration** âœ…

   - Implement GitHub API authentication (PAT token)
   - Create API client functions for basic workflow endpoints
   - Add error handling and rate limiting

3. **Simple workflow listing** âœ…
   - Create main entry point command `gh-actions`
   - Display workflows in a basic buffer
   - Show workflow name, status, and last run time

## Phase 2: Core Workflow Management

4. **Workflow details view**

   - Show workflow runs for selected workflow
   - Display run status, commit info, and timing
   - Add navigation between workflows and runs

5. **Basic transient interface**
   - Implement first transient menu for main actions
   - Add keybindings for refresh, view details
   - Basic help system

## Phase 3: Job Management

6. **Job viewing and navigation**

   - Show jobs for selected workflow run
   - Display job status, logs preview
   - Navigate between jobs and steps

7. **Log viewing**
   - Dedicated buffer for job logs
   - Syntax highlighting for log output
   - Auto-refresh for running jobs

## Phase 4: Interactive Actions

8. **Workflow control**

   - Re-run workflows and jobs
   - Cancel running workflows
   - Trigger manual workflows

9. **Enhanced transient menus**
   - Multi-level transient commands
   - Workflow-specific actions
   - Persistent settings and preferences

## Phase 5: Polish and Advanced Features

10. **Real-time updates**

    - Auto-refresh for running workflows
    - Status indicators and notifications
    - Async operations with proper feedback

11. **Advanced filtering and search**

    - Filter workflows by status, branch, author
    - Search across workflow names and runs
    - Date range filtering

12. **Integration features**
    - Magit integration (trigger workflows from commits)
    - Project.el integration
    - Customizable keybindings and themes

## Current Status

**âœ… Phase 1 Complete:** MVP with basic workflow listing, authentication, and API integration.

**ðŸ”„ Next:** Phase 2 - Workflow details and transient interface

Each phase builds incrementally, ensuring we have a working tool at every step while adding complexity gradually.

## Technical Notes

- Uses GitHub REST API v3 with proper authentication
- Supports GitHub CLI, git credential helper, and PAT authentication
- Built with transient for Magit-style interface
- Async operations with request.el
- Proper error handling and rate limiting
